								Collaboration is an important aspect of projects in the real world. However, the skill of actually being able to collaborate with a bunch of other people - all having expertise in different areas - is often something challenging that a lot of teams face, and this artifact aimed to tackle just that. The entire class compiled all the research they did while working on Artifact 1 individually, and while working in a team of 25, we developed a website showcasing all our work.

								<a href="#"><h4>Argument</h4></a>
								<p>
									I would say the purpose of this assignment is to again get acquainted with the overall dynamics of working in a team to achieve a common goal.
									<hr>
									The way the entire class tackled the process seems to have made this visible. The class was divided into several teams and most of the teams had specific tasks allocated to different people in the group.

								<a href="#"><h4>Genre / Media</h4></a>
								<p>
									The media we used for this artefact was basically videos of the actual films along with some synopsis and other basic details about the film.
									<hr>
									How we went ahead with this was through the compilation of all the research we did over the course of preparing our Research Portfolio for the first artefact of the course and reorganizing all the information we had into a consistently used format.

								<a href="#"><h4>Goals</h4></a>
								<p>
									I would consider the primary goal of the assignment to get the students work together as a group to work through the process of coming up with an idea, tackling problems that might oppose the overall idea, splitting the available resources (both human and non-human) based on their expertise, and later merging all of them to produce the final product.
									<hr>
									In terms of the communication strategies, this assignment aimed at all five of the communication skills from the WOVEN method â€“ written, oral, visual, electronic, and non-verbal.

								<img class="img-fluid" src="img/u2.jpg" alt="">

							<div class="single-events">
								
								<a href="#"><h4>Audience</h4></a>
								<p>
									Primarily, I would assume the intended audience of this assignment to be those who are looking to get a bit of insights into the dynamics of movie production during the early and mid-20th Century.
									<hr>
									Speaking generally, referring to the open nature of the overall website, I would also refer to the entire world having access to the internet to be my audience since anyone in the world at any time can access some of my work on this project without any restrictions.
								</p>
								<img class="img-fluid" src="img/u3.jpg" alt="">
							</div>							
							<div class="single-events">
								<a href="#"><h4>Intended Revisions</h4></a>
								<p>
									If I had more time, I would probably have worked a bit more on the design of the website.
									<hr>
									Probably, we might have also prepared the website to showcase a few more films by collaborating with other sections of the course.
