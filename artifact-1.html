								Researching about the assigned film from the Old Hollywood Era proved to be a key in me getting more immersed into the theme of the course - Adaptation of Technologies in the Old Hollywood Era. Not only did it encourage me to look for the film but it also allowed me to explore what might have been used to produce the films during the early 20th Century and what might have actually led to my film getting lost.

								<a href="#"><h4>Argument</h4></a>
								<p>
									I would say the purpose of this assignment to again get acquainted with how the texts written in the 19th and 20th Centuries were adapted into full-blown pieces of arts not just once per novel, but in some cases, more than twenty times per novel.
									<hr>
									Filmography in the research portfolio was one of the elements I used to make this visible. To reference, there were a couple of novels written by France Hodgson Burnett that have had more than fifteen movies made across more than ten countries.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="single-events">
								<img class="img-fluid" src="img/u4.jpg" alt="">
								<a href="#"><h4>Genre / Media</h4></a>
								<p>
									The media I used for this artefact was basically text (written) and image (visual) in a way that they complemented each other to proceed with my overall discussion in a bit more effective way.
									<hr>
									How I went ahead with this was through the compilation of all my research over the period of several weeks into a powerpoint presentation (which I later converted into a PDF file) along with the documentation of the conversation I had with everyone I contacted during the research phase.
								</p>

								<a href="#"><h4>Goals</h4></a>
								<p>
									I would consider the primary goal of the assignment to get the students acquainted with the background into how films in the Old Hollywood and New Hollywood Eras came into existence from being present as stories in novels written by pioneers in the time period to getting produced by a whole team of artists working together to image it for the audience.
									<hr>
									In terms of the communication strategies, this assignment also aimed at the written and visual communication skills along with the oral communication skills from the WOVEN method.
								</p>
								<img class="img-fluid" src="img/u2.jpg" alt="">
							</div>
							<div class="single-events">
								
								<a href="#"><h4>Audience</h4></a>
								<p>
									For this assignment, my intended audience is anyone who is willing to know a bit more about ENGL 1101 course and someone who is interested in knowing what I expect to learn from the course.
									<hr>
									I make the choice of my intended audience clear in the artifact by starting from talking about the challenges I was facing because of my limited oral communication skills to talking about how a course like ENGL 1101 can help tackle those challenges.
								</p>
								<img class="img-fluid" src="img/u3.jpg" alt="">
							</div>							
							<div class="single-events">
								<a href="#"><h4>Intended Revisions</h4></a>
								<p>
									If I had more time, I would have probably recorded a video introducing Frances Hodgson Burnett and how her work was used to adapt fromm for more than a Century to generate new works of art.
									<hr>
									Probably, I might have also contacted a few more people who might potentially provide more information about the movie I was researching on and also potentially get some insights into how the movies were created as a result of text adaptations.
